Git is a free, open-source, distributed version control system (DVCS) used to track changes in files and coordinate collaborative software development. It allows developers to efficiently manage projects, revert to previous versions, and branch out for new features or bug fixes. 

Here's a more detailed explanation of Git:

Distributed Version Control:
    Unlike centralized systems, Git stores a complete copy of the project's history on each developer's machine, enabling offline work and faster collaboration. 

Key Features:

    Cheap Local Branching: Git makes it easy to create and switch between different versions of the code, allowing for parallel development and experimentation. 

Staging Area: Before committing changes, developers can stage them in a staging area, allowing for selective inclusion of changes in a commit. 
Multiple Workflows: Git supports various collaborative workflows, including feature branching, Gitflow, and more.
